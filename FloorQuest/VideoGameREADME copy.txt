HELLO GOOD TRAVELLER!

This is a text-based game, meaning everything is done with typing words! When starting up the game, you will realize there are two classes:

Ranger: a long ranged bow type class in which you could tame pets and have them as companions to fight alongside with

Warrior: a brute forced type class in which you have a boatload of health and deal a ton of damage

Choose one and you are on your way to start your journey!

Helpful tips:
typing "map" will give you a map of the dungeon.
  1 = where you start
  3 = item location
  P = pet location (ranger class)
  E = end of the game/dungeon

The map coordinate F1-11 stands for floor 1, row 1, column 1.

typing "action" will give you a list of actions you can take out

P.S: there is a key and treasure somewhere on the map in the 0 spots, find them and claim your treasure!
